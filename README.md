Soundnode App
============

Soundnode App is an Open-Source project to support Soundcloud for desktop Mac, Windows, and Linux. <br>
It's built with Electron, Node.js, Angular.js, and uses the Soundcloud API.

> Be aware that Soundnode relies on Soundcloud API which only allows third party apps to play 15 thousand tracks daily. When the rate limit is reached all users are blocked from playing/streaming tracks. The stream will be re-enable one day after (at the same time) streams were blocked.
